## Summary  
This is the client side of my full-stack app. This app is a notes and essays management app for students.  
Users can add courses to their homepage. They can also change the color of the course by using the color-picker input.

Clicking on a course takes the user to the courses page. The title of the page is in the same color as they chose  
for that course. The course page contains the users notes and essays. This page also allows the user to add a new one.
